    <h2>About Unicus Mobility</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
        <p class="text">
            Unicus Mobility is a startup venture that intends to improve people's access to efficient,
            eco-friendly, and technologically advanced mobility solutions. We are on a mission to revolutionise
            the world of transportation with cutting-edge electric vehicles that blend brains, brawn, and
            sustainability.
            Inspired by the sight of frantic delivery fleets zipping through gridlocked streets on fossil-fueled bikes,
            we knew there had to be a better way. Further, we observed the hassles involved in the daily commute that
            are
            faced by students and urban professionals. And so, we set out to manufacture e-bikes that would not only
            ease
            the daily commute for all of them but would also be kind to the environment and their wallets.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Starting with a college project, we built an electric street bike with a 3000W hub motor and 72V battery
            pack, allowing us to reach a top speed of 80 kmph. But we did not stop there. For months, we ideated and
            convened numerous brainstorming sessions to come up with a plan to break into the micro-mobility segment.
            Our e-bikes are not your run-of-the-mill, dime-a-dozen electric bikes. They are lean, mean, eco-friendly
            machines that boast not only a sleek, space-saving design but also a rugged build to handle difficult Indian
            roads. Plus, we have loaded them up with the latest and greatest technology to give riders a truly
            intelligent, hassle-free ride. And the best part? Our e-bikes will not break the bank, so anyone can join
            the sustainable mobility revolution.
